                        Since our launch in 2007, our vision and focus has been to deliver high value projects for our
                        clients with the emphasis on communication, attention to detail and cost management.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We understand the importance of innovation and professionalism and work with the best people to
                        achieve this.
                    </p>
                    <p> Importantly, we have fun doing it. </p>

                    <small>
                        When Stonewood Construction was first conceived we set out to build a business model that
                        focused on quality and attention to detail. We soon realised the difficulty in sustaining this
                        model as a startup in the competitive environment of construction, but we persisted and stuck
                        to our ideals.
                    </small>

                    <small>
                        Today we operate with the confidence that our past has prepared us to embrace the most
                        challenging of projects.
                    </small>

                    <small>
                        Our clients and architects alike receive the benefit of the energy we put into our management
                        and site teams.

                        We are very happy to recommend Stonewood Construction. Ours was a large and demanding project,
                        requiring a high level of attention to detail and some significant challenges and we are very
                        happy with the final result.

                        We were lucky to have Jay involved from the earliest stages of planning with our architect and
                        his input allowed us to maximise value from the build. The onsite team were very professional.
                        Their workmanship was excellent as was their working relationship with us. The scale of the
                        project meant that logistical planning in our quiet residential street could have been
                        difficult but the onsite teamâ€™s interaction with our neighbours was extemely well handled.
